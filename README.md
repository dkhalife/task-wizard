# Task Wizard

**Privacy First, Productivity Always!**

Task Wizard is a free and open-source app designed to help manage tasks effectively. Its primary focus is to give users control over data and allow them to build integrations around it however they choose to.

This repo started as a fork of [DoneTick](https://github.com/donetick/donetick) but has since diverged from the original source code in order to accomplish different goals. Kudos to the contributors of [DoneTick](https://github.com/donetick/donetick) for helping kickstart this project.

## üéØ Goals and principles

Task Wizard's primary goal is to allow users to own and protect their data and the following principles are ways to accomplish that:

* All the user data sent by this frontend only ever goes to a single backend
* üîú When data is stored, it is encrypted with a user key
* The code is continuously scanned by a CI that runs CodeQL
* Dependencies are kept to a minimum
* When vulnerabilities are detected in dependencies they are auto updated with Dependabot

## ‚ú® Features

‚úÖ Fast and simple task creation and completion for those times you are in a hurry

üè∑Ô∏è Label assignment to help you categorize and recall tasks efficiently

üìÖ Due and completion dates tracking for users who need historical records

üîÅ Recurring patterns for those chores you don't want to forget

üìß Notifications for important deadlines you don't want to miss

üóùÔ∏è Fine-grained access tokens for endless integration possibilities

üåê Authenticated CalDAV endpoint at `/dav/tasks` with app token as the password

## üöÄ Installation

### üö¢ Using Docker Compose (recommended)

1. In a compose.yml file, paste the following:

```yaml
services:
   tasks:
      image: dkhalife/task-wizard
      container_name: tasks
      restart: unless-stopped
      ports:
      - 2021:2021
      volumes:
      - /path/to/host/config:/config
```

2. Run the app with `docker compose up -d` 

Alternatively, you can use a `.env` file and reference it in the compose file using an `env_file` entry.

### üõ≥Ô∏è Using Docker

1. Pull the latest image: `docker pull dkhalife/task-wizard`
1. Run the container:

```bash
docker run \
   -v /path/to/host/config:/config
   -p 2021:2021 \
   dkhalife/task-wizard
```

Make sure to replace `/path/to/host` with your preferred root directory for config.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

In the [config](./config/) directory are a couple of starter configuration files for prod and dev environments. The server expects a config.yaml in the config directory and will load settings from it when started.

**Note:** You can set `email.host`, `email.port`, `email.email`, `email.password`, `jwt.secret`, and OAuth configuration using environment variables for improved security and flexibility. The server will fail to start if `jwt.secret` is left as `"secret"`, so be sure to set `TW_JWT_SECRET` or edit `config.yaml`.

The configuration files are yaml mappings with the following values:

| Configuration Entry                      | Default Value                                       | Description                                                                 |

### üîê OAuth2 Configuration (Azure Entra ID Example)

Task Wizard supports OAuth2 authentication as an alternative to username/password authentication. This is particularly useful when integrating with identity providers like Azure Entra ID (formerly Azure AD).

#### Backend Configuration

1. Register two applications in your identity provider:
   - **Backend API App**: This will validate tokens and define scopes (e.g., `Tasks.ReadWrite`)
   - **Frontend Client App**: This will initiate the OAuth flow

2. Configure the backend via `config.yaml` or environment variables:

```yaml
oauth:
  enabled: true
  client_id: "your-backend-api-client-id"
  client_secret: "your-backend-api-client-secret"
  tenant_id: "your-tenant-id"  # For Azure Entra ID
  authorize_url: "https://login.microsoftonline.com/{tenant-id}/oauth2/v2.0/authorize"
  token_url: "https://login.microsoftonline.com/{tenant-id}/oauth2/v2.0/token"
  redirect_url: "https://your-domain.com/oauth/callback"
  scope: "api://your-backend-api-client-id/Tasks.ReadWrite"
  jwks_url: "https://login.microsoftonline.com/{tenant-id}/discovery/v2.0/keys"
```

Or via environment variables:
```bash
TW_OAUTH_ENABLED=true
TW_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID=your-backend-api-client-id
TW_OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET=your-backend-api-client-secret
TW_OAUTH_TENANT_ID=your-tenant-id
TW_OAUTH_AUTHORIZE_URL=https://login.microsoftonline.com/{tenant-id}/oauth2/v2.0/authorize
TW_OAUTH_TOKEN_URL=https://login.microsoftonline.com/{tenant-id}/oauth2/v2.0/token
TW_OAUTH_REDIRECT_URL=https://your-domain.com/oauth/callback
TW_OAUTH_SCOPE=api://your-backend-api-client-id/Tasks.ReadWrite
TW_OAUTH_JWKS_URL=https://login.microsoftonline.com/{tenant-id}/discovery/v2.0/keys
```

#### Frontend Configuration

Configure the frontend by setting environment variables during the build:

```bash
VITE_OAUTH_ENABLED=true
VITE_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID=your-frontend-client-id
VITE_OAUTH_AUTHORITY=https://login.microsoftonline.com/{tenant-id}/oauth2/v2.0/authorize
VITE_OAUTH_SCOPE=api://your-backend-api-client-id/Tasks.ReadWrite
VITE_OAUTH_REDIRECT_URI=https://your-domain.com/oauth/callback
```

#### Enabling OAuth in the UI

1. Navigate to Settings > Feature Flags
2. Enable the "Use OAuth 2.0 authentication" feature flag
3. The login page will now show an "Sign in with OAuth" button

**Note:** OAuth authentication and traditional username/password authentication can coexist. The feature flag controls which method is displayed to users.

#### Security Considerations

- **HTTPS Required**: OAuth must be used over HTTPS in production to protect tokens in transit
- **Token Storage**: JWT tokens are stored in browser localStorage for session management. This is standard practice for SPA authentication, but means tokens are accessible to JavaScript code. Ensure your application is protected from XSS attacks.
- **State Parameter**: OAuth state parameter is validated to prevent CSRF attacks
- **Token Expiration**: Configure appropriate token expiration times in your OAuth provider
- **Scope Restrictions**: Use minimal required scopes (e.g., `Tasks.ReadWrite`) to follow principle of least privilege

## üõ†Ô∏è Development

A [devcontainer](./.devcontainer/devcontainer.json) configuration is set up in this repo to help jumpstart development with all the required dependencies available for both the frontend and backend. You can use this configuration alongside
GitHub codespaces to jump into a remote development environment without installing anything on your local machine. For the best experience make sure your codespace has both repos cloned in it. Ports can be forwarded from within the container so that you are able to test changes locally through the VS Code tunnel.

### üìÉ Requirements
