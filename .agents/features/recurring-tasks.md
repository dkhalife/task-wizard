# Feature: Recurring Tasks

Tasks can be configured with a recurrence pattern so they automatically re-appear after completion.

## Capabilities

- Frequency types: once, daily, weekly, monthly, yearly, custom
- Custom frequency supports configurable intervals (every N hours/days/weeks/months/years)
- Custom patterns: specific days of the week or days of the month
- Rolling mode: next due date calculated from completion date instead of the original due date
- Optional end date to stop recurrence after a certain point
- Skipping advances to the next occurrence without recording a completion
